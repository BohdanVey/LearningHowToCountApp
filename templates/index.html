                        <p>One of the problems you may face is to calculate the number of permutations for some set,
                            which can contain the same symbols. It is a really common problem, which you can see a lot
                            of time in future. Objects in these problems are the length of the set, while classes are a
                            number of different elements. We think that the object in this problem is indistinguishable
                            because if we change the order of object, but object in every position will have the same
                            class,
                            then these permutations will be equal. But classes are distinguishable.
                            <br>
                            Example: Calculate the number of permutations for the letter from word MISSISSIPPI.
                            <br>
                            Objects: 11, indistinguishable
                            <br>

                            Classes: 5, distinguishable
                            <br>

                            STEP 1: Calculate number of permutations if each letter werr different$$P(n) =n!$$
                            STEP 2: Calculate how often each letter appears in the word.
                            $$M = 1$$
                            $$I = 4$$
                            $$S = 4$$
                            $$P = 2$$
                            STEP 3: Because when we swap the same letters, our permutation remains the sam we
                            <br>
                            should divide our answer from STEP 1 by number of permutations of each letter.
                            <br>
                            $$N = {N_{total}\choose{N_{M} N_{I} N_{S} N_{P}}} = {11\choose{1\text{ }4\text{
                            }4\text{ }2}} = 34650$$
                        </p>
                        <p>Here you can write your own word and get number of permutation for it</p>

                            This is by far the least trivial class of problems. On the first glance, the fact that the
                            classes are indistinguishable changes little to nothing: you only need to divide the result
                            from
                            the case where they are distinguishable by the number of classes. Consider the problem with
                            distributing balls between urns, represented by the equation
                            $$n_{1}+n_{2}+...+n_{k} = M$$
                            In it, we imagine that the
                            urns are distinguishable, and thus get additional solutions that only differ by which balls
                            are
                            in which urns. By making the urns indistinguishable, we can extract those redundant
                            solutions
                            and only keep the ones that are truly distinct.
                            However, this doesn’t change the inherent structure of the problem. All we need to do is to
                            divide the original result by \(k!\). So let’s try to dive a little bit deeper into the
                            subject.

                            What if we don’t limit ourselves to a set number of classes? In this case, the result would
                            be
                            all possible ways to distribute \(M\) balls between any number of urns, not just necessarily
                            \(k\). This
                            class can be thought of as attempting to divide a positive integer into parts, without
                            taking
                            the order of the parts into account, like this:
                            $$7=3 + 2 + 1 + 1$$
                            In number theory, such a process is called <b>partitioning</b>, while the resulting division
                            of
                            the
                            number is called a <b>partition</b>, or an <b>integer partition</b>. The summands of a
                            partition
                            are often
                            called <b>parts</b>.

                            An example of all possible partitions of a number would be:
                            $$4 = 2 + 2 = 3 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$$
                            Counting the whole number as a partition too (put all 4 balls in one group), the number 4
                            can be
                            partitioned in 5 different ways. Notice that we don’t count \(1 + 3\), for instance, because
                            it
                            only
                            differs from \(3 + 1\) in its order. Because of this, it is a common convention to write the
                            parts
                            in decreasing order.

                            Unfortunately, you will not find a simple way to count the number of partitions for any
                            positive
                            integer N here. This function often denoted as \(p(n)\), does not have a known closed-form
                            expression. However, there is still a lot to learn

                            <a href="https://oeis.org/A000041">about it</a>.
                            <br>
                            Partitions of a number are usually expressed through either a

                                diagram</a>.
                            While I won’t use any of them here, you can look them up to gain a visual intuition on
                            partitions. In particular, they will help you understand a few interesting facts about
                            partitions, such as conjugate partitions and partitions with distinct parts.

                            <br>
                            <b>Conjugate partitions</b> are created by “flipping” a diagram of a partition along its
                            main
                            diagonal.
                            Algebraically speaking, for a given partition (example: \(7 = 4 + 2 + 1\)) a conjugate is
                            created by
                            counting the number of parts in a partition, subtracting 1 from each part, and then
                            repeating
                            the process until nothing remains (for the above example, the conjugate would be \(7 = 3 + 2
                            + 1
                            +
                            1\)). <b>Self-conjugate partitions</b> are ones that transform into themselves using this
                            process, like
                            \(6 = 3 + 2 + 1\).

                            <b>Partitions with distinct parts</b> are ones in which no number occurs more than once.
                            These are
                            usually denoted as \(q(n)\), and have their own generating function as well as a recurrence
                            relation
                            given by the pentagonal number theorem. I will not be going to talk about them here though,
                            as
                            they do not relate to the combinatorics in question at all.
                            <br>
                            \(p_{k}(n)\) is the number of partitions of a number n that contain precisely k parts.
                            This relates back to the question with urns and balls: k is the number of urns. Obviously,
                            $$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n{p_{k}(n) = p(n)}$$
                            Since conjugate partitions are constructed using the amount of parts
                            in the original partition, the largest part in a conjugate is always
                            the size of the original. Using this fact, \(p_{k}(n)\) can be expressed
                            as the number of partitions where the largest part is exactly \(k\).
                            By subtracting \(k\), this number is equal to \(p(n-k)\).

                            Now that we’re familiar with the concepts at hand, we can tackle directly calculating p(n).
                            A generating function for p(n) is a reciprocal of the Euler’s function and looks like this:
                            $$\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty{p(n)x^n}=\prod\limits_{k = 1}^\infty{\frac{1}{1-x^k}}$$
                            The asymptotic growth rate of the partition function is given by
                            \(log(p(n)) \approx C\sqrt{n}\text{ }as\text{ }n -> \infty, where\text{ }C =
                            \pi\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\).
                            <br>
                            Finally, we can try to limit both the number of parts as well as the largest part in a
                            partition. Let \(p(N, M, n)\) denote the number of partitions of \(n\) with at most \(M\)
                            parts, each of
                            size at most \(N\). Equivalently, these are the partitions whose Young diagram fits inside
                            an
                            \(M×N\) rectangle. There is a recurrence relation
                            $$p(N, M, n) = p(N, M-1, n) + p(N-1, M, n-M)$$
                            obtained by observing that \(p(N, M, n) - p(N, M-1, n)\) counts the partitions of \(n\) into
                            exactly
                            \(M\) parts of size at most \(N\), and subtracting 1 from each part of such a partition
                            yields a
                            partition of \(n − M\) into at most \(M\) parts.
                            <br>
                            We can see that integer partitions are a broader and a more difficult class of problems than
                            simple combinatorial ones, and that there is a lot to study about them. However, diving
                            deeper into advanced mathematics is always a useful exercise that is worth doing.
